            <p>Hello students,</p><p>For those of you interested in following the Python tutorials of this course, hereis a short summary of what you need to know in Object-oriented programming. In the Python tutorials, I will be talking about classes,objects and methods. Please find below a clear explanation of what these concepts are:</p><p>A class is the model of something we want to build. For example, if we make a houseconstruction plan that gathers the instructions onhow to build ahouse, then thisconstruction plan is the class.</p><p>An object is an instance of the class. So if we take that same example of the house construction plan, then an object is simply a house. A house (the object)that was built by following the instructions of theconstruction plan (the class).<br>And thereforethere can be many objects of the same class, because we can build many houses from theconstruction plan.</p><p>A method is a tool we can use on the object to complete a specific action. So in thissame example, a tool can be to open the main door of the house if a guest is coming. A method can also be seen as a function that is applied onto the object, takes some inputs (that were defined in the class) and returns some output.</p><p>Hope thishelps you get the intuition ofObject-oriented programming, don't hesitate to ask for more explanations in the Q&amp;A if anything is unclear.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Hadelin</p>
