            <p>Hey Data Scientist,</p>

<p>Congrats on completing all (or part)of the Machine Learning course!</p>

















<p><em>(Note:if you don't like reading long texts, then skip to the bottom. Your bonus is there!)</em></p>

<p>Such a big course, right?What did you like most about it?I liked the SVMtutorials and the Kernel trick. That wasreally cool:)</p>

















<p>So.... the obvious question is what's next?</p>







<p>We've got some good news for you!</p>







<p>Not so long ago Hadelin and Iran Kickstarter campaign to create what we believe is the World's most disruptive course on Deep Learning.</p>







<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/?couponCode=YESDATA" rel="nofollow"><strong>And that's how we created DeepLearning A-Z</strong></a></strong></strong></strong><strong></strong></p>







<p>In side this course you get 6 modules:</p>



<ul><li>Artificial Neural Networks (like in the MLcourse +advanced tutorials)</li><li>Convolutional Neural Networks(like in the MLcourse +advanced tutorials)</li><li>Recurrent Neural Networks</li><li>Self-Organizing Maps</li><li>Boltzmann Machines</li><li>AutoEncoders</li></ul>



<p>Just like in the Machine Learning course, each modulecomes with easy-to-digest intuition tutorials and very hands-on practical applications solving Real-World challenges. Note:this course is Python-only.</p>



<p>This is the fastest way to get up-to-speed with one of the most powerful technologies in the World Right now!</p>

<p><strong>If you are just starting out into Deep Learning,</strong>then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course.You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.<br></p>









<p><strong>If you already have experience with Deep Learning,</strong>you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.</p>







<p>Plus!during the Kickstarter we raised over $150,000 AUDmeaning the following stretch goals were unlocked. While #1 doesn't make a difference now - #2 and #3 are two huge advantages available to you in the course as soon as you join:</p>
