       "'Wayne White of American Pest scouts the Washington Post newsroom for signs of mice. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)  Wayne White walked into an office building in downtown Washington, trying to think like a mouse.  His expert eye took in the things that make a rodent feel at home amid the cubicles: the half-finished salad on one desk, the communal box of cinnamon buns on another, the piles of paper, the utility conduits that are subway tunnels to the tiny. And in the surrounding ergonomic chairs, the biggest vermin enablers of all: Us.  Mice aren’t just eeking (sorry) out a living in Washington offices, they’re thriving. Along with roaches, rats and other creepy crawlies, they are as common in the fluorescent habitat as lawyers and lobbyists. The little opportunists share space with the big opportunists in congressional suites, intelligence bunkers and newsrooms (more on that later).  President Andrew Johnson was known to feed mice at his desk. Barbara Bush once swam with a rat she described as “enormous” in the White House pool. (She credited her springer spaniel Millie and the country’s commander-in-chief with drowning it.) Jimmy Carter grew furious when the General Services Administration and the Interior Department argued over which agency was responsible for the dead mouse he smelled in the walls of the Oval Office.  “I doubt there’s an office building in Washington that doesn’t have them,” said White, director of technical services for American Pest, which treats millions of square feet of office and commercial space around the region.     A partially eaten apple danish and sunflower seed shells are spotted near the loading dock of the building that houses The Washington Post. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)  What makes the office mouse different from his house and church cousins is the human ecosystem of the workplace. In the mixing bowl of an office, there are widely different views on food handling and cleanliness, and then a lot of finger pointing when the rodents come sniffing for crumbs. Further, staffers who are terrified of mice often clash with those who want to protect them.  “Mice in offices are a different situation,” White said. “Sometimes a person will say ‘I hope you’re not going to hurt them.’ And the person next to them will say, ‘I hope you’re going to nuke them!’\\u200a”   [For Metrorail, it’s one man vs. mouse (and rat)]  White has known animal-loving office workers to spring the traps he has left behind, turning mouse bait into mouse hors d’oeuvres.  Those tensions may be particularly high in Washington, where eating-at-your-desk is a daily ritual for many, and animal welfare is a local industry.  Even at the Dupont Circle headquarters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, there are mixed feelings about pest control.  “\\u200a‘Pests,’ I don’t like that word,” said PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk.  When Newkirk found mice in her office a few years ago, her instinct was to applaud. But one of her animal-rights activists was so unnerved by the sight of a mouse dropping, she wanted to work from home. Newkirk — who considers mice “unobtrusive role models” — told the woman to “man up.” “They are one 200th your size and they are harmless,” she said. “Live and let live, for God’s sake.” Eventually, they released the mice outside and sealed all the cracks they could find. More recently, Newkirk used nail-polish remover to free a beetle she found stuck to a strip of tape on a FedEx package. Two people objected to bugs in the office kitchen.  “I told them ‘They only come out at night,’\\u2009” she said. “\\u200a‘If you’re nervous, send someone in to turn the light on for you.’\\u200a”   var urlRegex=/(\\\\b(https):\\\\/\\\\/[-A-Z0-9+&@#\\\\/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Z0-9+&@#\\\\/%=~_|])/ig,endPointString=\"Map(pattern -\\\\x3e https://polls.washingtonpost.com/userpolls/games/webapi/poll/{id}, id -\\\\x3e poll, content -\\\\x3e Simple Id Content Config)\",WPGames=WPGames||{};WPGames.common=WPGames.common||{};WPGames.common.api=WPGames.common.api||{};WPGames.common.api[\"4d3a8356-a211-45aa-a1d6-83773a1dbdec\"]=endPointString.match(urlRegex)[0].replace(/\\\\/poll\\\\/$/,\"\");var shareURL=encodeURIComponent(\"\");\\nwindow.interactiveOmniture=window.interactiveOmniture||{};window.interactiveOmniture[\"4d3a8356-a211-45aa-a1d6-83773a1dbdec\"]={id:\"4d3a8356-a211-45aa-a1d6-83773a1dbdec\",type:\"interactive\",subtype:\"poll-embed\",embed:\"true\"}; \\n    {\"userId\":\"c3b06394-1cf3-4b3e-952c-7206f26e528b\",\"userType\":\"ANONYMOUS\",\"gameId\":\"4d3a8356-a211-45aa-a1d6-83773a1dbdec\",\"correctAnswers\":0,\"wrongAnswers\":0,\"answeredQuestions\":0,\"game\":{\"gameId\":\"4d3a8356-a211-45aa-a1d6-83773a1dbdec\",\"sectionId\":\"local\",\"blogName\":\"\",\"title\":\"Mice in the workplace\",\"byline\":\"Tim Richardson\",\"bylineBioPage\":\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/tim-richardson\",\"articleReferences\":[],\"createdTimestamp\":1457728304815,\"archive\":false,\"allowMoreThanOnce\":false,\"createdBy\":\"RICHARDSONTD1\",\"lastUpdatedBy\":\"RICHARDSONTD1\",\"live\":false,\"photoUploaded\":false,\"embedToggles\":[{\"headline\":false,\"byline\":false}],\"captchaProtected\":false,\"questions\":[{\"questionId\":\"a18c3cde-e8ca-4486-9179-1774dca0ac1e\",\"questionText\":\" Which side are you on when it comes to mice in the workplace? “Live and let live.” “Nuke them!”'"
