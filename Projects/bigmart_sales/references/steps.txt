We will explore the problem in following stages:

Hypothesis Generation – understanding the problem better by brainstorming possible factors that can impact the outcome
Data Exploration – looking at categorical and continuous feature summaries and making inferences about the data.
Data Cleaning – imputing missing values in the data and checking for outliers
Feature Engineering – modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis
Model Building – making predictive models on the data
